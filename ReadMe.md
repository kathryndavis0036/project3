# Analyzing Sports Across the United States

## Overview

This project involved scraping revenue data of major sports leagues in the United States from a web page and comparing them to participation across the country from a dataset that included participation across the states in high school. We processed it using Python libraries, and performed data analysis on the various sports participation statistics.

The code was divided into three main sections:

1. Web scraping and data extraction from a webpage.
2. Analysis of sports participation statistics from a CSV file.
3. Calculation of top sports participation statistics for boys and girls per state.

## Requirements

To run this project, we used the following Python libraries:
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

## Consent and Privacy:
Ensure that the data we scraped did not include personally identifiable information.
Purpose and Use of Data:
Be clear about the purpose of our project and how the data will be used.
Ensure that the data was used in a way that benefits the community and does not cause harm.
