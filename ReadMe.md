# Analyzing Sports Across the United States

## Overview

This project involved scraping sponsorship revenue data of major sports leagues in the United States from a web page and comparing them to participation across the country. We processed it using Python libraries, and performed data analysis on various sports participation statistics. The code was divided into three main sections:

1. Web scraping and data extraction from a webpage.
2. Analysis of sports participation statistics from a CSV file.
3. Calculation of top sports participation statistics for boys and girls per state.

## Requirements

To run this project, we used the following Python libraries:
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
